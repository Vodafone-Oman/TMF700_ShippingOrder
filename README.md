# TMF700_ShippingOrder
The Shipping Order service is an entity service that provides the necessary functionality to create, update and query Shipping Orders. A Shipping Order is a document used by a business to specify what items are to be transferred from a storage location or warehouse to which person and to which new location. A ShippingOrder typically is sent along with a shipment of goods so that the person receiving them can verify that the document correctly reflects the items that they actually received.
